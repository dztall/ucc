<b><u>CompactStar engine</u></b>

The CompactStar engine is a tiny game engine I'm using for my own purposes. On the Mobile C Compiler it serves me as base to create small game prototypes.

<b>Here are the actual supported features</b>
- Simple shapes creation (surface, box, sphere, cylinder, disk, ring and spiral)
- Quake I (.mdl), DirectX (.x, partially), and WaveFront (.obj, partially) models
- Animations for Quake I (.mdl) and DirectX (.x) models
- Skybox
- Landscape generation
- Transparency
- Bump mapping
- Full-scene antialiasing and post-processing effects
- Collision detection (partially, ground and mouse collision)
- Particles system (early stage, see the Weather demo and Spaceship game demo)
- Physics (early stage, see the Wild Soccer demo)
- Sound and music
- Cross-platform SDK written in C
- Objective-C Metal renderer for OSX/iOS (experimental)

<b>Here are some screenshots of several projects I realized with this engine (all are available as demo)</b>

<b>Supported compiler versions and devices</b>

The CompactStar Engine is fully supported by the Mobile C Compiler since the version 2.4.1. Earlier versions may not work well, or not work at all.

Also, provided demos are targetting devices since iPhone 6. Earlier devices may run the demo very slowly, or not at all.

<b>To go further</b>

An advanced version of this SDK is also available, which contains more demos and advanced tools or prototypes, like an early stage 2D level designer.
