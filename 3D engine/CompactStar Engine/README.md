<b><u>CompactStar engine</u></b>

The CompactStar engine is a tiny game engine I'm using for my own purposes. On the Mobile C Compiler it serves me as base to create small game prototypes.

<b>Here are the actual supported features</b>
- Simple shapes creation (surface, box, sphere, cylinder, disk, ring, spiral and capsule)
- Quake I (.mdl), DirectX (.x, partially), Collada (.dae, partially) and WaveFront (.obj, partially) models
- Animations for Quake I (.mdl), DirectX (.x) and Collada (.dae) models
- Skybox
- Landscape generation
- Transparency
- Bump mapping
- Full-scene antialiasing and post-processing effects
- Collision detection (partially - geometry, ground and mouse collision)
- Particles system (early stage, see the Weather demo and Spaceship game demo)
- Physics (early stage, see the Wild Soccer demo)
- Artificial intelligence (early stage, see the Bot demo)
- Sound and music
- Cross-platform SDK written in C
- Objective-C Metal renderer for OSX/iOS (experimental)

<b>Here are some screenshots of several projects I realized with this engine (all are available as demo)</b>

<b>Supported compiler versions and devices</b>

The CompactStar Engine is fully supported by the Mobile C Compiler since the version 2.4.1. Earlier versions may not work well, or not work at all.

Also, provided demos are targetting devices since iPhone 6. Earlier devices may run the demo very slowly, or not at all.

<b>About the Collada format support</b>

The Collada (.dae) format support is partial and was planned to support very simple models. For that reason several restrictions should be considered:
- Only triangles are supported in geometry, for that reason the Triangulate option should be activated in exporter. See e.g. the following Blender exporter screenshot:
![Screenshot](Common/Images/Screenshots/BlenderExporterGeom.png?raw=true "Screenshot")
- The skeleton should be as simple as possible. Avoid to create more than 1 skeleton
- Avoid to create many textures, if possible, create only one RGB texture per model
- For animations, only matrix transformations and linear interpolations are supported. See e.g the following Blender exporter screenshot:
![Screenshot](Common/Images/Screenshots/BlenderExporterAnim.png?raw=true "Screenshot")
- Only one 3d model is supported by scene. Complex scenes, or advanced features like cameras and lights may prevent the model to be opened correctly
- An example of well supported model is available [here](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/lowpoly-cat-rig-run-animation-c36df576c9ae4ed28e89069b1a2f427a)

<b>To go further</b>

An advanced version of this SDK is also available, which contains more demos and advanced tools or prototypes, like an early stage 2D level designer.
